                "descripcion": "Marco A. Giraldo, Ph.D. is the leader of the Biophysics Group and Professor at the Institute of Physics of the University of Antioquia (Medellin, Colombia). His experience in the area of biophysics ranges from the structural coloration in Nature to cell physiology. His most important contributions in the area of biophotonics lay in the understanding of the relationship between the nanostructures present in butterfly wings and bird feathers, and their optical properties. He has used both experimental and computational approaches in his scientific work, developing new sophisticated tools to that aim. His professional career has been developed at the University of Antioquia, where he received his bachelor degree as Physicist in 2003. After receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands), supervised by Prof. Doekele Stavenga, he returned to Medellín in 2008 where he was oﬀered a position as Assistant Professor. Since then he has been the leader and creator of the Biophysics Group. Since November of 2021 he became full professor at the Institute of Physics in the same university. His grants have been mostly funded by the Colombian Ministry of Science, the University of Antioquia’s Science Committee and cofunded by the AFRL of the United States in association with the University of Groningen. His main international research partners and co-authors are in The Netherlands, Japan, USA, France, Brasil and Germany. Dr. Giraldo has also been active in the dissemination of science to a wider audience. He has been invited to share his work in EXPLORA, Medellin’s science park, and other spaces like high and primary schools. He has also written science related articles in universities’ magazines. His interest for foreign languages and cultures has permitted that he is fluent in Spanish and English, and proficient in Dutch."
