        "brief_description": "Biophotonics is the study of the interaction of light with biological materials. It combines biology and photonics (the science of light) to develop imaging, sensing, and therapeutic techniques. Applications of biophotonics include medical imaging (like optical coherence tomography), disease diagnosis, and minimally invasive treatments using laser technology.",

        "brief_description": "Cell electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties of cells, particularly the flow of ions across cell membranes and the resulting electrical currents. This field is essential for understanding how cells, especially neurons and muscle cells, generate and respond to electrical signals. Techniques like patch-clamp recording are used to study ion channels, action potentials, and cellular responses to stimuli.",

        "brief_description": "The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a protective barrier that surrounds the cell. It regulates the entry and exit of substances, maintains the cell's structural integrity, and facilitates communication with other cells. Composed mainly of lipids and proteins, the cell membrane plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as signaling, adhesion, and transport of nutrients.",
