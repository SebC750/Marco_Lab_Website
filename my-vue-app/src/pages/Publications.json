    "abstract": "Como si se tratara del sistema nervioso de los humanos y otros animales, se ha descubierto que las plantas también tienen la capacidad de generar y transmitir señales eléctricas de una célula a otra. Estos mensajes eléctricos les ayudan a crecer, a responder al sol y al agua, oa protegerse de los insectos. El laboratorio de los grupos de Biofísica y PHYSIS ha medido propiedades eléctricas de células animales (corazón y neuronas), y ahora se ha enfocado en hacer estas mediciones en las plantas, siendo el primer laboratorio del país en este tipo de investigaciones. muscipula) para cerrar sus hojas y atrapar la presa: algún insecto, o, incluso, alguna pequeña rana desprevenida. A pesar de que en estas dos plantas la respuesta eléctrica está asociada a un movimiento rápido bastante notorio y llamativo, no son las únicas que presentan dinámicas eléctricas; de hecho, estos fenómenos hidro-electro-químicos están en todas las plantas cumpliendo diversos roles fisiológicos, desde regular el intercambio de gases y determinar la direccionalidad del crecimiento hasta desatar mecanismos de defensa, o incluso comunicarse con otros organismos. De esta manera, las plantas, a pesar de sus hábitos sésiles, son organismos activos que censan su medio y responden de acuerdo con las condiciones de este. Las plantas son consideradas por algunos investigadores como organismos inteligentes, con memoria y capaces de aprender, todo esto gracias a la señalización eléctrica.",

    "abstract": "The spider species Pamphobeteus verdolaga was recently discovered in the Aburra’s Valley, Colombia. A bioinformatics analysis of the venom gland’s transcriptome identified numerous peptides with potential effects on ion channels. Of those, three were then synthetized through Fmoc solid-phase methods (referred to as vrdg peptides). Since vrdg172 and vrdg183 possess two disulfide bridges, we hypothesize that they block ion channels, compared with vrdg66, which is a linear peptide. In this study, we evaluated the effects of vrdg66, vrdg172 and vrdg183 on Ca2+ (ICaL) and K+ (IK) currents in mouse cardiomyocytes using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. When used at a concentration of 1 μM, vrdg66 showed a minor inhibitory effect on the peak amplitude of ICaL (−16.3±10.5%; n=6) and IK (−24.4±4.4%; n=5), compared with the control current. At the same concentration, vrdg172 similarly blocked ICaL (−38.8±15.6%; n=4) and IK (−43.9±5.8%; n=3). Interestingly, vrdg183 demonstrated a weak inhibitory effect on the peak IK (−6.2±24.6%; n=3) and a sizeable inhibitory effect on ICaL (−66.7±6.5%; n=4). In a further characterization of vrdg183, the blocking effect on ICaL was confirmed in isoproterenol-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Finally, a concentration-effect curve (10, 100, 300, 1000 and 10000 nM; n=4 for each experimental point) allowed us to calculate an IC50 for vrdg183 of 858.28 nM. The activation and inactivation kinetics were not affected by any of the concentrations tested. In summary, we report novel spider toxins that inhibit mammalian voltage-gated ion channels, likely acting as pore blockers. The vrdg183 toxin exhibits a selective inhibitory effect on ICaL over IK, with moderate affinity (Grant 111577757673, Minciencias, Colombia).",
